   The present-day borders of Bangladesh took shape during the Partition of Bengal and British India in 1947,<br> when the region used to be known as East Pakistan, as a part of the newly formed state of Pakistan.<br> It was separated from West Pakistan by 1,400 km of Indian territory.<br> Due to political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination and economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, nationalism, popular agitation and civil disobedience led to the Bangladesh Liberation War and independence in 1971.<br> After independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress.<br> In 2014, the Bangladeshi general election was boycotted by major opposition parties, <br>resulting in a parliament and government dominated by the Awami League and its smaller coalition partners.<br>
